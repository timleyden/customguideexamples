## Resource Provider Policies
In Contoso, the creation and modification of subscription resources is controlled by a series of policies. The key policies that will impact you are the following:

- Resource Location: As part of our data sovereignty compliance all resources need to be created in the Australia East or Australia SouthEast regions. 
    - If you need an exception please contact [Contoso Help Desk](help@microsoft.com). We perform quarterly audits of this requirement through the Azure Policy management experience.
